# RESTART

Robot Enhanced Social abilities based on Theory of mind for Acceptance of Robot in assistive Treatments

The RESTART project aims at designing and developing a new human-robot interactive paradigm, in which the robot is humanized thanks to empowered AI-based social abilities based on the concept of theory of mind and mutual-understanding in order to improve the acceptability of robots especially in assistance scenarios, where higher legibility and conformity to cognitive and emotional aspects of the interaction are required.
